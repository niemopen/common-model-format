## CMF and RDF representation in NIEM 6 

The first section is about things that involve some sort of change to the NDR.  The second section (TBD) lists all the mapping patterns between NIEM XSD and CMF, between NIEM XML, JSON, and RDF.

### Changes to NIEM 5

All of these involve some sort of change to the NDR, mainly in the section (5.6) describing the RDF equivalents of NIEM XML and XSD.  Very few require any change to the NIEM model as represented in XSD.  CMF mappings aren't really a change, but are included anyway.

* Create data properties for simple content
* Distinguish object properties from data properties
* Simple content with metadata requires appinfo
* Use RDF-star annotations for relationship metadata
* Use metadata element name in JSON and RDF
* Disallow IDs and URIs on data properties
* Support metadata as a related child object
* Replace `structures:sequenceID`
* Relative URIs are blank nodes in messages with no URI
* Specify the RDF interpretation of `xml:lang` in messages

#### Create data properties for simple content

NIEM 5 handling of simple content makes sense for XML and XSD.  It doesn't make as much sense for a serialization that doesn't have the attribute/element distinction -- which is pretty much all of the others.  When an attribute is used to place a property on a literal value, the NIEM 5 mapping is:

```
<nc:PersonGivenName                       |  _:n0 nc:PersonGivenName _:n1 .
  nc:partialIndicator="true">             |  _:n1 nc:partialIndicator "true" .
  Fred                                    |  _:n1 rdf:value "Fred" .
</nc:PersonGivenName>                     |  _:n1 a PersonNameTextType .
```

(Note: examples may omit closing tags, etc. for brevity and easier reading.)

That is unconventional RDF.  The `rdf:value` property is not commonly used in RDF data.  The usual practice for this situation, where you want to have a property applied to the literal value "Fred", is to have two RDF properties:  a data property for the literal value, and an object property to hold the literal and the property on the literal.

The JSON equivalent is worse.  We must turn every element having a complex type with simple content (CSS) into a JSON object with a `rdf:value` key, whether or not it has an attribute.  Or we must force developers to test every access to a CSC property to see if, this time, the value is a literal or an object.  This is the *ugly JSON* problem.

We can have a more neutral NIEM 6, something better aligned to all supported serializations, by creating a CMF data property when needed for the value of a CSC type.  We need to do this whenever a CSC includes a *semantic attribute*; that is, an attribute not from the structures namespace.  For example, for this CSC definition

```
<xs:complexType name="NumericType">
  <xs:simpleContent>
    <xs:extension base="niem-xs:decimal">
      <xs:attribute ref="nc:toleranceNumeric" use="optional"/>
    </xs:extension>
  </xs:simpleContent>
</xs:complexType>
```

we would create the `NumericValue` data property, forming this CMF:

```
<Class>
  <Name>NumericType</Name>
  <Namespace s:ref="nc"/>
  <HasProperty>
    <Property s:ref="nc:NumericValue"/>
    <MinOccurs>1</MinOccurs>
    <MaxOccurs>1</MaxOccurs>
  </HasProperty>
  <HasProperty>
    <Property s:ref="nc:ToleranceNumeric"/>
    <MinOccurs>0</MinOccurs>
    <MaxOccurs>1</MaxOccurs>
    <AttributeIndicator>true</AttributeIndicator>
  </HasProperty>   
</Class>
```

There are thirty-five such CSC definitions in the NIEM 5.1 model.  For thirty-one of them, we can create a `FooValue` property for each `FooType`  CSC.  There are four problem CSCs in the CBRN namespace, where we can't do that, because the namespace already has a `FooValue` property.  There we either create a `FooLiteralValue` property, or persuade CBRN to change those types.

NIEM 6 uses these created CMF data properties in JSON and RDF, instead of `rdf:value`.  There are examples in the following section.

*XML changes:*  Changes in NDR.  No change to existing NIEM XSD.  No change to instance data in message formats migrating to NIEM 6.

*Alternative:*  We could retain the `HasValue` property in the existing CMF specification.  But then CMF models would seem strange to everyone but XML developers.  We would also get ugly JSON containing the strange `rdf:value` key.

#### Distinguish object properties from data properties

The section above replaces `rdf:value` with created data properties.  We also need a way for NIEM 6 message models to distinguish data properties from object properties. This is necessary so that JSON developers can always know whether the value of a property will be an object or a literal.  Otherwise they have to write code to check that at runtime.  (YAML and protobuf developers will probably have the same concern.)

A data property in XSD is an attribute declaration, or an element declaration with a CSC type that has no semantic attributes.  In CMF it becomes a property with a datatype, like this:

```
<xs:element                               |  <Property>
  name="Amount"                           |    <Name>Amount</Name>
  type="niem-xs:decimal"/>                |    <Namespace s:uri="nc"/>
                                          |    <Datatype s:uri="xs:decimal"/>
```

An instance of a data property in XML has the following JSON and RDF equivalents:

```
<nc:Amount>1.2</nc:Amount> |  "nc:Amount": 1.2     |  _:n0 nc:Amount 1.2 .
```

An object property in XSD is an element declaration with a type that has complex content or a CSC type that has semantic attributes.  In CMF it becomes a property with a class, like this:

```
<xs:element                               |  <Property>
  name="ActivityName"                     |    <Name>ActivityName</Name>
  type="nc:TextType"/>                    |    <Namespace s:uri="nc"/>
<xs:complexType name="TextType"           |    <Class s:uri="nc:TextType">
  <xs:complexContent>                     |      <Name>TextType</Name>
    <xs:extension base="niem-xs:string">  |      <Namespace s:uri="nc"/>
      <xs:attribute                       |      <HasProperty>
        ref="nc:partialIndicator"         |        <Property s:uri="nc:TextValue"/>
        use="optional"/>                  |        <MinOccurs>1</MinOccurs>
```

An instance of an object property in XML always becomes an object in JSON and RDF, even if the element has no attributes.  Note the created `nc:TextValue` data property.

```
<nc:ActivityName>     |  "nc:ActivityName": {          |  _:n0 nc:ActivityName _:n1 .
  FOO                 |   "nc:TextValue": "FOO"        |  _:n1 a nc:TextType .
</nc:ActivityName>    |  }                             |  _:n1 nc:TextValue "FOO" .
                      |                                |
                      |                                |
```

If the attributes are removed from the message model subset, the CSC becomes a synonym for the XSD built-in datatype, and the element declaration becomes a data property:

```
<xs:element                               |  <Property>
  name="ActivityName"                     |    <Name>ActivityName</Name>
  type="nc:TextType"/>                    |    <Namespace s:uri="nc"/>
<xs:complexType name="TextType"           |    <Datatype s:uri="nc:TextType">
  <xs:complexContent>                     |      <Name>TextType</Name> 
    <xs:extension base="niem-xs:string"/> |      <Namespace s:uri="nc"/>
                                          |      <RestrictionOf>
                                          |        <Datatype s:uri="xs:string"/>
                                          |      </RestrictionOf>
```

And then the XML elements of this type have these equivalents in JSON and RDF:

```
<nc:ActivityName>     |  "nc:ActivityName": "FOO"      |  _:n0 nc:ActivityName "FOO" .
  FOO                 |                                |
</nc:ActivityName>    |                                |
```

Semantic attributes are frequently removed from a message model subset, so the simple case is also the common case.

*XML changes:*  Changes in NDR.  No change to existing NIEM XSD.  No change to instance data in message formats migrating to NIEM 6.

*Alternative:* If we retain the current handling of CSCs, we get either (a) ugly JSON with `rdf:value` for every literal value, or (b) ugly JSON where developers must write code to test every property with a CSC type.

#### Simple content with metadata requires appinfo

Simple content can have metadata.  It usually doesn't, but it can.  Metadata is an attribute on an XML element.  For reasons described above, we want the message model to distinguish between CSCs with attributes and CSCs without.  NIEM 6 XSD schemas do this via metadata appinfo on the CSC defintion, like this:

```
<xs:complexType name="PercentType" appinfo:metadataIndicator="true">
  <xs:simpleContent>
    <xs:extension base="niem-xs:decimal"/>
  </xs:simpleContent>
</xs:complexType>
```

The equivalent CMF model has a created data property and a metadata indicator property, like this:

```
<Class>
  <Name>PercentType</Name>
  <Namespace s:ref="nc"/>
  <HasProperty>
    <Property s:ref="PercentValue"/>
    <MinOccurs>1</MinOccurs>
    <MaxOccurs>1</MaxOccurs>
  </HasProperty>
  <MetadataIndicator>true</MetadataIndicator>
</Class>
```

Every XML element of that type then turns into a JSON or RDF object with a created data property, even elements without a metadata attribute, like this:

```
<nc:Percent>          |  "nc:Percent" : {              |  _:n0 nc:Percent _:n1 .
  50.0                |    "nc:PercentValue": 50.0     |  _:n1 a nc:PercentType .
<nc:Percent>          |  }                             |  _:n1 nc:PercentValue 50.0 .
```

And with a metadata attribute, the JSON and RDF equivalents are:

```
<nc:Percent             |  "nc:Percent": {             |  _:n0 nc:Percent _:n1 .
  s:metadata="md">      |    "nc:Metdata": {           |  _:n1 a nc:PercentType .
  50.0                  |      "@id": "_:md",          |  _:n1 nc:PercentValue 50.0 .
</nc:Percent>           |      "nc:SourceText": "FOO"  |  _:n1 nc:Metadata _:md .
<nc:Metadata s:id="md"> |    },                        |  _:md a nc:MetadataType .
  <nc:SourceText>       |    "nc:PercentValue": 50.0   |  _:md nc:SourceText "FOO" .
    FOO                 |  }                           |
  </nc:SourceText>      |                              |
</nc:Metadata>          |                              |
```

The schema can also apply metadata appinfo only to particular element declarations, and not to the CSD definition; for example, a subset of the MilOps namespace might declare:

```
<xs:element name="DamagePercent" type="nc:PercentType" appinfo:metadataIndicator="true"/>
```

In this case, the CMF model still has a created data property, but the metadata indicator goes on the property object, and other properties become data properties:

```
<Property>
  <Name>DamagePercent</Name>
  <Namespace s:ref="mo"/>
  <Class s:ref="nc:PercentType"/>
  <MetadataIndicator>true</MetadataIndicator>
<Property>
<Class s:id="nc:PercentType">
  <Name>PercentType</Name>
  <Namespace s:ref="nc"/>
  <HasProperty>
    <Property s:ref="PercentValue"/>
    <MinOccurs>1</MinOccurs>
    <MaxOccurs>1</MaxOccurs>
  </HasProperty>
</Class>
<Property>
  <Name>Percent</Name>
  <Namespace s:ref="nc"/>
  <Datatype s:ref="xs:decimal"/>
<Property>
```

And then the JSON and RDF equivalents are:

```
<nc:Percent>            |  "nc:Percent": 50.0          |  _:n0 nc:Percent 50.0
  50.0                  |                              |
</nc:Percent>           |                              |

<mo:DamagePercent>      |  "mo:DamagePercent": {       |  _:n0 mo:DamagePercent _:n1 .
  40.0                  |    "nc:PercentValue": 40.0   |  _:n1 a nc:PercentType .
</mo:DamagePercent>     |  }                           |  _:n1 nc:PercentValue 40.0 .

<mo:DamagePercent       |  "mo:DamagePercent": {       |  _:n0 mo:DamagePercent _:n1 .
  s:metadata="md">      |    "nc:Metadata": {          |  _:n1 a nc:PercentType .
  45.0                  |      "@id": "_:md",          |  _:n1 nc:PercentValue 45.0 .
</mo:DamagePercent>     |      "nc:SourceText": "FOO"  |  _:n1 nc:Metadata _:md .
<nc:Metadata s:id="md"> |    },                        |  _:md a nc:MetadataType .
  <nc:SourceText>       |    "nc:PercentValue": 45.0   |  _:md nc:SourceText "FOO" .
    FOO                 |  }                           |
  </nc:SourceText>      |                              |
</nc:Metadata>          |                              |
```

For enforcement we will require a new rule in the NDR section on instance data, something like

> An element having a complex type with simple content,
> and having either a structures:metadata or structures:relationshipMetadata attribute,
> MUST have an element declaration OR a type definition with appinfo:metadataIndicator="true"

*XML changes:*  Changes in NDR.  Change to XSD in message specifications migrating to NIEM 6, if and only if messages can have metadata on simple content.  No change to instance data in message formats migrating to NIEM 6.

*Alternative:* If the message model doesn't identify the elements with CSC type that can have metadata, we're back to ugly-JSON choices from the previous section.

#### Use RDF-star annotations for relationship metadata

RDF-star and JSON-LD-star provide the extensions we need to avoid ugly JSON with relationship metadata.  In the following example (from NDR 5), the metadata does not apply to the person object or to the location object.  It declares the source of information for the relationship between person and location.

```
<nc:Person>
  <nc:PersonBirthLocation structures:relationshipMetadata="wp-ds">
    <nc:Address>
      <nc:AddressCityName>Bethesda</nc:AddressCityName>
      <nc:AddressState>
        <nc:StateName>Maryland</nc:StateName>
      </nc:AddressState>
    </nc:Address>
  </nc:PersonBirthLocation>
  <nc:PersonName>
    <nc:PersonFullName>Daniel Stern</nc:PersonFullName>
  </nc:PersonName>
</nc:Person>
<nc:Metadata structures:id="md">
  <nc:SourceIDText>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Stern_(actor)</nc:SourceIDText>
</nc:Metadata>
```

The RDF-star equivalent is:

```
_:n0 nc:Person _:n1 .
_:n1 nc:PersonBirthLocation _:n2 {| nc:Metadata _:md |} .
_:n1 nc:PersonName _:n4 .
_:n2 nc:Address _:n3 .
_:n3 nc:AddressCityName "Bethesda" .
_:n3 nc:AddressState "Maryland" .
_:n4 nc:PersonFullName "Daniel Stern" .
_:md nc:SourceIDText "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Stern_(actor)" .
```

And the JSON equivalent is:

```
"nc:Person": {
  "nc:PersonBirthLocation": {
    "nc:Address": {
      "nc:AddressCityName": "Bethesda",
      "nc:AddressState": "Maryland"
    },
    "@annotation": {
      "nc:Metadata": {
        "nc:SourceIDText": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Stern_(actor)"
      }
    }
  },
  "nc:PersonName": {
    "nc:PersonFullName": "Daniel Stern"
  }
}
```

*XML changes:*  Changes in NDR.  No change to existing NIEM XSD.  No change to instance data in message formats migrating to NIEM 6.

*Alternatives:*  Ugly JSON, or no relationship metadata.

#### Use metadata element name in JSON and RDF

The NIEM 5 NDR uses `structures:metadata` as the JSON key and RDF property for object metadata, like this:

```
<nc:PersonName          | "nc:PersonName": {            |  _:n0 nc:PersonName :_n1 .
  s:metadata="md">      |   "s:metadata": {             |  _:n1 s:metadata _:md .
  <nc:PersonFullName>   |     "@id": "_:md",            |  _:n1 nc:PersonFullName "Tom" .
    Tom                 |     "nc:SourceText": "ABC"    |  _:n1 a nc:PersonNameType .
  </nc:PersonFullName>  |   },                          |  _:md nc:SourceText "ABC" .
</nc:PersonName>        |   "nc:PersonFullName": "Tom"  |  _:md a nc:MetadataType .
<nc:Metadata s:id="md"> | }                             |
  <nc:SourceText>       |                               |
    ABC                 |                               |
  </nc:SourceText>      |                               |
</nc:Metadata>          |                               |
```

There is no good reason to inject the structures namespace into NIEM JSON or NIEM RDF instance data.  NIEM 6 uses the name of the metadata property -- `nc:Metadata`, in this case -- instead.  All of the above examples follow the new practice.

*XML changes:*  Changes in NDR.  No change to existing NIEM XSD.  No change to instance data in message formats migrating to NIEM 6.

*Alternatives:* We don't have to make this change, but then I sure would like someone to explain why using `structures:metadata` is better.

#### Disallow IDs and URIs on data properties

Recall that an instance of a data property in XML has the following JSON and RDF equivalents:

```
<nc:Amount>1.2</nc:Amount> |  "nc:Amount": 1.2     |  _:n0 nc:Amount 1.2 .
```

There is no place for `structures:id`, `structures:ref`, or `structures:uri` in that JSON or RDF.  Those attributes only work for object properties; for example:

```
<nc:Percent s:id="xx"> |  "nc:Percent" : {              |  _:n0 nc:Percent _:xx .
  50.0                 |    "nc:PercentValue": 50.0,    |  _:n0 a nc:PercentType .
<nc:Percent>           |    "@id": _:xx                 |  _:xx nc:PercentValue 50.0 .
                       |  }                             |
```

NIEM 6 NDR needs a rule to forbid IDs and URIs on data properties.  Something like:

> An element with `structures:id` or `structures:uri` MUST have complex content, or simple content with attributes, or simple content with `appinfo:metadataIndicator="true"`, or an element declaration with `appinfo:metadataIndicator="true"`

*XML changes:*   Changes in NDR.  Change to XSD in message specifications migrating to NIEM 6 if and only if messages have IDs or URIs on simple content.  Change to instance data in message formats migrating to NIEM 6 if and only if messages have IDs or URIs on simple content.

*Alternatives:* Allowing IDs or URIs on data properties takes us back to the land of ugly JSON.

#### Support metadata as a related child object

A metadata object in NIEM 5 is never related to its parent by virtue of the parent/child relationship.  Metadata in NIEM 5 applies only through a metadata attribute.  For instance, in the following example (with some closing tags omitted), the RDF equivalent does *not* include the triple `_:n0 nc:Metadata _:md` , because the message object is not related to the metadata object.

```
<my:Message>                             |  _:n0 nc:Person _:n1 .
  <nc:PersonName s:metadata="md">        |  _:n0 a my:MessageType .
    <nc:PersonFullName>Fred              |  _:n1 nc:PersonFullName "Fred" .
  </nc:PersonName>                       |  _:n1 nc:Metadata _:md .
  <nc:Metadata s:id="md">                |  _:n1 a nc:PersonNameType .
    <nc:SourceIDText>ABC                 |  _:md nc:SourceIDText "ABC" .
  </nc:Metadata>                         |  _:md a nc:MetadataType .
</my:Message>                            |
```

It is easy to make an error in the JSON equivalent.  Below, the JSON on the left incorrectly asserts a relationship between the message object and the metadata object.  The JSON on the right is the correct equivalent to the above XML and RDF.

```
"my:Message": {                          |  "my:Message": {
  "nc:PersonName": {                     |    "nc:PersonName": {
    "nc:PersonFullName": "Fred",         |      "nc:PersonFullName": "Fred,
    "nc:Metadata": { "@id": "_:md" }     |      "nc:Metadata": {
  },                                     |         "@id": "_:md",
  "nc:Metadata": {                       |         "nc:SourceIDText": "ABC"
    "@id": "_:md",                       |      }
    "nc:SourceIDText": "ABC"             |    }
  }                                      |  }
}                                        |
```

In NIEM 6, a metadata object without an ID or URI *is* related to its parent.  For instance, in the following example, the metadata object applies to the message object:

```
<my:Message>                             |  _:n0 nc:Person _:n1 .
  <nc:PersonName>                        |  _:n0 nc:Metadata _:md .
    <nc:PersonFullName>Fred              |  _:n0 a my:MessageType .
  </nc:PersonName>                       |  _:n1 nc:PersonFullName "Fred" .
  <nc:Metadata>                          |  _:n1 a nc:PersonNameType .
    <nc:SourceIDText>ABC                 |  _:md nc:SourceIDText "ABC" .
  </nc:Metadata>                         |  _:md a nc:MetadataType .
</my:Message>                            |
```

If necessary, a single metadata object may be related to its parent and also related to another object by a metadata attribute through the use of `structures:ref`, as follows:

```
<my:Message>
  <nc:Metadata s:ref="md"/>
  <nc:Metadata s:id="md">
    <nc:SourceIDText>ABC
  </nc:Metadata>
  <nc:PersonName
    s:metadata="md">
    <nc:PersonFullName>Fred
  </nc:PersonName>
</my:Message>
```

This change doesn't quite allow a message designer to establish a mandatory metadata property in the XSD representation of his message model.  (Yes, the schema can have `minOccurs="1"` or higher, but the schema can't require a child without ID or URI.)  It's as close as we can get.

*XML changes:*  Changes in NDR.  No change to existing NIEM XSD.  No change to instance data in message formats migrating to NIEM 6.

#### Replace structures:sequenceID

NIEM 5 uses the`structures:sequenceID` attribute in instance data to indicate the order of repeated child properties.  For example, the following data represents the name of the hero in Dorothy Sayers detective novels, *Peter Death Bredon Wimsey*:

```
<nc:PersonName>
  <nc:PersonGivenName">Peter
  <nc:PersonMiddleName s:sequenceID="1">Death
  <nc:PersonMiddleName s:sequenceID="2">Bredon
  <nc:PersonSurName>Wimsey
```

This is clunky, and does not have a good RDF interpretation.  NIEM 6 removes the `sequenceID` attribute from the structures namespace, and adds `orderedPropertyIndicator` to the appinfo namespace.  The new appinfo is used like this:

```
<xs:complexType name="PersonNameType">
  <xs:complexContent>
    <xs:extension base="structures:ObjectType">
      <xs:sequence>
        <xs:element ref="nc:PersonGivenName"/>
        <xs:element ref="nc:PersonMiddleName minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"
            appinfo:orderedPropertyIndicator="true"/>
        <xs:element ref="nc:PersonSurName"/>
      </xs:sequence>
```

The equivalent CMF model would contain:

```
<Class>
  <Name>PersonNameType</Name>
  <Namespace s:ref="nc"/>
  <HasProperty>
    <Property s:ref="nc:PersonGivenName"/>
    <MinOccurs>1</MinOccurs>
    <MaxOccurs>1</MaxOccurs>
  </HasProperty>
  <HasProperty>
    <Property s:ref="nc:PersonMiddleName"/>
    <MinOccurs>0</MinOccurs>
    <MaxOccurs>unbounded</MaxOccurs>
    <OrderedPropertyIndicator>true</OrderedPropertyIndicator>
  </HasProperty>
  <HasProperty>
    <Property s:ref="nc:PersonSurName"/>
    <MinOccurs>1</MinOccurs>
    <MaxOccurs>1</MaxOccurs>
  </HasProperty>
</Class>
```

Given the above models, the example XML has the following equivalent RDF:

```
_:n0 nc:PersonName _:n1 .
_:n1 a nc:PersonNameType .
_:n1 nc:PersonGivenName "Peter" .
_:n1 nc:PersonMiddleName ( "Death" "Bredon" ) .
_:n1 nc:PersonSurName "Wimsey" .
```

For the JSON equivalent we need to get the `@list` keyword into the context, like this:

```
{
  "@context": {
    "nc": "http://release.niem.gov/niem/niem-core/5.0/#",
    "nc:PersonMiddleName":  { "@container": "@list"}
  },
  "nc:PersonName": {
    "nc:PersonGivenName": "Peter",
    "nc:PersonMiddleName": [ "Death", "Bredon"],
    "nc:PersonSurName": "Wimsey"
  }
}
```

*XML changes:*   Changes in NDR.  Change to XSD in message specifications migrating to NIEM 6 if and only if messages depend on `structures:sequenceID` to specify order of repeated properties.  Change to instance data in message formats migrating to NIEM 6 if and only if messages likewise depend on `structures:sequenceID`.

*Alternative:*  If we don't somehow remove `structures:sequenceID` from CSCs, we will have ugly JSON.

#### Relative URIs are blank nodes in messages with no URI

> A NIEM data exchange may be ephemeral and ad hoc. That is, a message may be transmitted without any expectation of persistence. Such a message exists only to exchange data and may not have any universal meaning beyond that specific exchange. As such, a message may or may not have a URI as an identifier. [[NDR 5.4](https://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/naming-and-design-rules/5.0/niem-ndr-5.0.html#section_5.4)]

The value of `structures:uri` can be an absolute URI, in which case its interpretation is as follows:

```
<my:Message>                            |  _:n0 a my:MessageType .
  <nc:Person s:uri="http:/me.com/p1/">  |  _:n0 nc:Person <http://me.com/p1/> .
    <nc:PersonFullName>                 |  <http://me.com/p1/> a nc:PersonType .
      FRED                              |  <http://me.com/p1/> nc:PersonFullName "Fred" .
```

The value of `structures:uri` can also be a relative URI.  In this case, its interpretation depends on the URI of the entire message.  There are three possibilities:

1. The message URI is part of the message, given by an`xml:base` attribute on to the root element.
2. The message URI is supplied outside the message by some implementation-dependent means.
3. The message does not have a URI.

When the message has a URI, the interpretation of `structures:uri` with a relative URI value is:

```
<my:Message                             |  @base <http://me.com/msg/> .
    xml:base="http://me.com/msg/">      |  <> a my:MessageType .
  <nc:Person s:uri="#p1">               |  <> nc:Person <#p1> .
    <nc:PersonFullName>                 |  <#p1> a nc:PersonType .
      FRED                              |  <#p1> nc:PersonFullName "FRED" .
```

At present the NDR does not provide the interpretation of `structures:uri` with a relative URI value in a message that does not have a URI.  We need to do that.  The correct interpretation is a blank node, as follows:

```
<my:message>                            |  _:n0 a my:MessageType .
  <nc:Person s:uri="#p1">               |  _:n0 nc:Person _:p1 .
    <nc:PersonFullName>                 |  _:p1 a nc:PersonType .
      FRED                              |  _:p1 nc:PersonFullName "FRED" .
```

I think we also need a new NDR rule:  The value of a `xml:base` attribute MUST be an absolute URI.  I'd love to also say that it MUST be an attribute of the root element, but we might not want to do that.

*XML changes:*  Changes in NDR.  No change to existing NIEM XSD.  No change to instance data in message formats migrating to NIEM 6.

#### Specify the RDF interpretation of `xml:lang` in messages

The `xml:lang` attribute has lexical scope.  In the following, "en" is the language identification of the first `nc:Comment` element, and "de" of the second.

```
<my:Message xml:lang="en">
  <nc:Comment>Sneeze</nc:Comment>
  <my:Block xml:lang="de">
    <nc:Comment>gesundheit</nc:Comment>
  </my:Block>
</my:Message>
```

The RDF equivalent presents no difficulties.  Turtle has a nice syntax for language identification.

```
_:n0 a my:MessageType .
_:n0 nc:Comment "Sneeze"@en .
_:n0 my:Block _:n1 .
_:n1 nc:Comment "gesundheit"@de .
```

Notice that we have language identifications on triples from XML elements that don't have the `xml:lang` attribute.  That's how lexical scope works.

In JSON-LD we have to use the `@language` key.  That means we must have an object to hold that key, and so `nc:Comment` has to be an object property with a created data property, like this:

```
"my:Message": {
  "nc:Comment": {
    "@language": "en",
    "nc:CommentValue": "Sneeze"
  },
  "my:Block": {
    "nc:Comment": {
      "@language": "de",
      "nc:CommentValue": "gesundheit"
  }
}
```

That's all fine and dandy if the relevant CSC type (here, `nc:TextType`) in our subset schema includes `xml:lang`.  But if it doesn't -- and I think in most message specifications, it does not -- then we get ugly JSON for every element that can possibly appear within the scope of an `xml:lang` attribute. 

The solution is to change the RDF interpretation of `xml:lang` in the NDR, so that it only applies where you've asked for it -- specifically, only to elements with a string-valued CSC definition that includes `xml:lang`.  If you care about language identification, put `xml:lang` into your message schema, and pay the price in processing complexity.  If you don't care about language identification, don't put it into your message schema, and enjoy the benefit of simplicity.

*XML changes:*  Changes in NDR.  No change to existing NIEM XSD.  No change to instance data in message formats migrating to NIEM 6.
