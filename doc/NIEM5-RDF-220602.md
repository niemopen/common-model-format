#### NIEM 5 RDF

In NIEM 5.0, every XML element is equivalent to a JSON-LD object and a RDF resource.  This includes the elements with simple content.  For example, according to NDR 5.0, this is equivalent XML, JSON, and RDF:

```
<ns:Foo>Fred</ns:Foo>      |  {                           |  _:n0 ns:Foo _:n1 .   
                           |    "ns:Foo" : {              |  _:n1 rdf:value "Fred" .
                           |      "rdf:value": "Fred"     | 
                           |     }                        |
                           |  }                           | 
```

This does come in handy when we have attributes or metadata on simple content:

```
<ns:Foo ns:a="x">          |  {                           |  _:n0 ns:Foo _:n1 .
  Fred                     |    "ns:Foo" : {              |  _:n1 ns:a "x" .
</ns:Foo>                  |      "ns:a": "x",            |  _:n1 rdf:value "Fred" .
                           |      "rdf:value": "Fred"     | 
                           |     }                        |
                           |  }                           |    
```

And it's absolutely essential if you use an IDREF pointer to simple content:

```
<ns:Bar>                   |  {                           |  _:n0 ns:Bar _:n1 .
  <ns:Foo s:id="name1">    |    "ns:Bar": [               |  _:n0 ns:Bar _:n2 .
    Fred                   |      {                       |  _:n1 ns:Foo _:name1 .
  </ns:Foo>                |        "nc:Foo": {           |  _:n2 ns:Foo _:name1 .
</ns:Bar>                  |          "@id": "name1",     |  _:name1 rdf:value "Fred" .
<ns:Bar>                   |          "rdf:value": "Fred" |
  <ns:Foo s:ref="name1"/>  |        }                     |
</ns:Bar>                  |      },                      |
                           |      {                       |
                           |        "nc:Foo": {           |
                           |          "@id": "name1"      |
                           |        }                     |
                           |      }                       |
                           |    ]                         |
                           |  }                           |
```

That's what NDR 5 says.  It's better than NDR 4, and way better than NDR 3.  But I don't think it's quite right.    I foresee immediate difficulty with the JSON crowd and eventual difficulty with the ontology crowd.

The JSON crowd will grudgingly swallow the `@id` key.  You can't represent a graph structure in JSON without some sort of reference or pointer key, and `@id` is no worse than the next choice.  But they are not going to swallow that `rdf:value` key.

Our JSON specification does its best to make `rdf:value` more palatable by defining *literal-to-object conversion* and *NIEM JSON normalization*.  In "plain NIEM JSON" data, the `rdf:value` key is only used when necessary.  For example, plain NIEM JSON looks like this:

```
<ns:Foo>Fred</ns:Foo>      |  { "ns:Foo": "Fred" }        |  _:n0 ns:Foo _:n1 .
                           |                              |  _:n1 rdf:value "Fred" .
```

And that can be normalized to the expanded form of JSON-LD, for conformance checking or whatever.  As a result, JSON developers don't have to see `rdf:value` on every simple property.  But they do have to check for it!  The value of the `ns:Foo` key could be a JSON string, or it could be a JSON object containing a `rdf:value` key.  No way to tell which in advance.  They'll have to write code to check every time they're trying to access a literal.  I don't think they will tolerate that.

The problem I foresee with the ontology crowd is that almost every property in NIEM 5 is an object property.  The only data properties are the attribute declarations.  That means `rdf:value` all over the place in NIEM RDF.  I don't think that's usual.  My sense is that `rdf:value` is not used very much.  It seems to be a tactic used when you thought you had a data property, and once everyone was accustomed to your data property, you discovered it was really an object property.  For example, suppose everyone is used to seeing 

```
_:fred my:weightMeasure "195.0" .
```

And then, oh crap! here come the French, and we need to specify units of measure.

```
_:fred my:weightMeasure _:n0 .
_:n0 my:measureUnits "kilograms" .
_:n0 rdf:value "84.8" .
```

But if you had done your modeling right in the first place, you would have defined a `weightMeasure` class.  Something a lot like `nc:MeasureType`.

```
_:fred my:weightMeasure _:n0 .
_:n0 my:measureUnits "kilograms" .
_:n0 my:measureValue "84.8" .
```

So I think NIEM 5 RDF is an outlier, strange to the ontology crowd.  I don't think we want that.
