# Common Model Format Specification

This repository is part of the NIEM Open Project.  It contains the NIEMOpen Common Model Format Specification (CMF).  

CMF is a NIEM message specification for data models,  In all versions of NIEM through version 5, data models are expressed in XML Schema (XSD).  CMF offers an equivalent expression, one that is more suitable for developers not working in XML and is easier to support with developer tools.  Using CMF, a data model can be expressed as XML or JSON or any other data serialization that NIEM supports, and the data described by the CMF data model can also be expressed in any supported serialization.  

CMF is extensively described in the [NIEM Naming and Design Rules, Version 6.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/niemopen/ndr/v6.0/ndr-v6.0.html).

For more information on NIEMOpen, see the project's website at [www.niemopen.org](www.niemopen.org).

General questions about OASIS Open Projects may be directed to OASIS staff at project-admin@lists.oasis-open-projects.org

## Examples

The [*Crash Driver Report*](https://github.com/iamdrscott/CrashDriver) message specification is designed to test and describe the features of the NIEM technical architecture.  It contains a NIEM model in equivalent CMF and XSD representations.

## Where are the original versions of CMF?

The pre-OASIS history of CMF is at [NIEM-Metamodel (github.com)](https://github.com/NIEM/NIEM-Metamodel)
